# betaflight-mobile-configurator
Minimal phonegap-wrapper for running the betaflight configurator on mobile devices.

Clone the repo, update the submodule inside of the www-folder and deploy.

Tested on iPhone/iPad, but not on Android.

For tablets, the original stylesheet for the configurator works fine.

For phones, the layout is not ideal and usage on phones is not recommended at the moment. Someone would need to create a suitable responsive stylesheet for that formfactor.
